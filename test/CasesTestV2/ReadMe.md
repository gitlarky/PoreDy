# Descriptions:

The simulation-setting files here generated the data basis for my two papers about deep learning on fast micro-structures evaluation and micro-structures optimization design:
1.
2.

The drying cases are all running at the same material properties, the same surrounding environments, and the same numerical settings. The only differences are the throats diameters, cross-section shapes, and their position arrangement relative to the opening side.
